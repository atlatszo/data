This project submission is explicitly targeted at building an enhanced version of the company’s current compliance management product ‘MetaCompliance’.    Specifically the objective of the project is to build a more comprehensive, automated, feature rich and scalable version of the initial ‘MetaCompliance’ product.    With the ever increasing growth and challenges surrounding regulation and legislation Baronscourt identified the need for companies and public sector organisation to undertake regular compliance assessments e.g. health & safety, IT security (ITIL and ISO 27001) and data protection. The usual mechanism for meeting these requirements is via an employee survey. This can present considerable organisational difficulties due to staff availability, workload and timeliness of completion. This situation is often exacerbated when multiple surveys may be running concurrently and other work activities must also be attended to.    The existing MetaCompliance product suite has been built to automate and streamline this process with the flagship product ‘MetaCompliance Policy Enterprise’ targeted at the larger organisations. The product suite was initially developed using Delphi and C languages but has subsequently migrated to make use of Microsoft’s .Net development tool suite. The software makes use of an intelligent policy software engine and distributed computing technologies to co-ordinate and manage the distribution and acknowledgement of compliance checks."

The objective of this project is to develop a wheel chair accessible VW Caddy Maxi for the mobility market that will meet the European Whole Vehicle Type Approval (ECWVTA) Requirements. Once granted the European Type approval, the company will no longer be required to have each vehicle individually tested and are free to export into any European country without having to meet any further approval standards.      Developing a vehicle to comply with the ECWVTA standards will require considerable design and development work to be completed in order to pass a stringent testing programme. Challenges include:    •	Develop a new wiring loom for the vehicle and gaining EMC approval.   •	Modify the chassis design to include new wheel arches and aluminium floor and the hydraulic lift system. The modified chassis requires to be pull tested to M1 standards and the full design is subject to audit by the European approval board.  •	Develop structural anchor points in the vehicle for seats and seat belts. TBC are required to fit out a vehicle shell with seat and seatbelts, which is then subjected to 20G forces in a sledge test.  •	The approval required detailed documentation to be stored on designs, manufacturing process and testing, which is subject to audit."

They need to offer an expanded product range that would assist in insulating the business from the downturn. Cross have identified a market demand for concrete underground tanks to store liquid. Initially this came about when they were approached by another local business Rainvault (an Invest NI Client) who was looking for a more local supplier of concrete tanks for their rain water harvesting system.     Cross carried out a review of the market and considered that there were opportunities not only with Rainvault but also with a range of other businesses and other market sectors.     They noted that they would not be the largest player in the sector and therefore would not be able to achieve the economies of scale that larger producers of tanks would have.     Therefore in this project the company would design and detail reinforced concrete underground tanks with a maximum diameter of 2.4m to store liquid.

The first part relates to the development of a ‘Dump Controller’ product, with is designed to allow more of the energy generated by the turbine to be utilised. Currently, in situations where turbines are connected to batteries, up to 50% of the energy can be wasted, as once the batteries are fully charged, any surplus energy is simply ducted to an inductor and dissipated to the atmosphere as heat energy. Similarly in installations were the turbines are grid connected, up to 35% of the energy can be lost, as the grid connections are limited by the size of the inverter, with surplus energy again being ducted to an inductor.        This electronic controller will operate by splitting the power generated by the turbine across up to different four channels, depending on the input level and preset priorities. For example, during times of low power generation 100% of the energy may be directed into the mains circuit of the house to cover the base load, and as the level of energy generation increases, power would be diverted to other channels which could include domestic hot water and space heating, depending on the present priorities. The controller would also incorporate feedback loops, so that when rooms or the hot water has reached certain levels, the energy can be diverted to the next priority area. The controller should significantly increase the efficiency of the turbine system, providing the customer with increased savings and reduced payback periods."

Within that group there are a smaller number of businesses which are creating digital content in areas such as games, multimedia and broadcast and e-learning which are well established and have strong growth plans. In addition, there is a substantial ‘tail’ of businesses serving local markets and of informal businesses who may be preparing to trade on a formal basis or simply earning additional income from their creative skills.  During development of this strategy businesses suggested that more needed to be done for the sector in terms of animation, making connections and presenting the North West digital content offering in a confident manner in wider markets. We also noted that the businesses felt isolated and were seeking to solve their own problems themselves rather than working in association with other businesses and/or the business support structures.  There is, therefore, an opportunity to improve the functioning of the businesses and of the business support structures by bringing them together, by increasing the knowledge and understanding in digital businesses of the support available to them and by increasing the knowledge in the business support organisations of the issues facing digital content businesses in the North West. This needs to be done in a way which respects and complements the role of regional business support organisations, such as Invest NI and Digital Circle and which respects and complements the existing business support organisations in Derry and the North West.  The overall strategic aim of the Digital Derry Strategy would, therefore, be to increase the rate of growth of the digital content sector in the City by   raising awareness and understanding of the needs of the sector,   developing local initiatives to complement regional support mechanisms,   animating sectoral networks and   raising awareness of the City’s digital content offering in wider markets.    An two-year action plan has been identified and agreed to deliver on these four strategic aims. This submission is seeking the required financial resources to take this strategic plan forward with the ultimate aim of growing the digital sector within the city and creating sustainable and high value employment."

By working together the project will make flexible, specific suppport more accessible to local businesses. Where there is no current provision by stakeholder organisations specialist expertise will be contracted to help initiate the business solution (pre-cleared areas). Ultimately the business is the key beneficiary receiving a single, specific itinerary of support developed and agreed between local ED stakeholders and specialist experts. All project partners will be able to track development of participant businesses along the entrepreneurial pipeline via online client management. The project is a continuum for business growth (ie. there is no start or end date for participants over the three year pilot).     Collaborative soluions will be developed via the project where common business issues are identified.     The project maximises all support and advice currently available and will be promoted via www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk to optimise access to information and tangible services in the Borough of Castlereagh."

Essentially, they lack the competence for proper business planning and for constructing and presenting a robust proposition that will convince a lender of its market potential and financial viability. The difficulties are further compounded by the current attitude of banks to lending to businesses particularly those without adequate security and a track record of borrowing.     The challenge for a programme such as this is to build capability that will not only help  small businesses to bring forward realistic propositions but also nurture and instil the necessary confidence to negotiate and secure appropriate funding options with lenders. This 2-year programme will involve a series of group workshops with up to 100 suitable participating businesses along with one-to-one mentoring support across five Council areas.

The project partners include Newtownabbey, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Moyle, Larne and Carrickfergus Councils.      The public sector in Northern Ireland spends around £1.6bn each year on public procurement out of a total budget of some £7bn. Local suppliers play an increasingly important part in delivering the core business of the Northern Ireland public sector, including local government. However, industry representatives such as the NI Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses have indicated their concerns that small firms are missing out on public sector business and that this trend will continue as public procurement methodologies become more complex moving increasingly into modern e-tendering processes. As the public sector reduces in size it is anticipated that the private sector will be afforded new opportunities to bid for services and supplies but only those firms capable of modern procurement methodologies may be able to access these.     Local sourcing initiatives for small firms delivered by economic development agencies and Councils have been available for several years but not specifically geared towards accessing public sector opportunities through e-procurement. Many small firms however are discouraged from tendering for public sector contracts because of a number of perceived or real barriers; these include:    	Not being able to find out about opportunities  	Believing that the processes involved in bidding are unnecessarily complex and costly  	recent trends in government procurement towards larger and longer contracts  	rationalising the number of suppliers, meaning that smaller businesses often find the resulting contracts too large for them  	Failing to understand and meet exacting quality assurance and environmental management requirement     Four capacity building programmes will be run, two each year recruiting a total of 60 small businesses/owner managers from across the north east region and at venues within easy reach of participants. Each programme will commence with an awareness raising event held in the evenings and selection will be based on clear criteria to ensure suitability.  A fee of £50 per participant will be charged as a way of gaining commitment and to demonstrate value. Participants will be required to attend six half day workshops that will provide detailed guidance on identifying and constructing tenders using a computer software application similar to that adopted by public sector bodies. Workshops will be supported by 2 days one-to-one consultancy for each participant on their premises to help with tender preparation.      A suitable delivery agent will be recruited with specialist expertise in public procurement and a proven knowledge of electronic tendering systems. Practitioners in modern quality assurance and environmental management systems will form part of the delivery team. The agent will also be required to demonstrate a track record in delivering effective support programmes and consultancy services to small business owners.       Programme content to include guidance on legal contracts and drawing up partnership agreements.    	Recruiting 60 small business owners  	Running 4 workshops  	Delivering 80 one-to-one consultancy support sessions    	Increased sales of at least 20% for each business completing the programme   	Reduction in costs of at least 20% for each business completing the programme"

The need for the project was identified through research completed by Fermanagh Economic Development Organisation in 2010.  A survey that they conducted of 175 local businesses in Fermanagh District Council area found that 86.4% of these businesses indicated that the lack of ""provision of information on grants and funding"" constituted a barrier to growth and 64.7% indicated the ""absence of a local business support point of contact"" to be either an important or very important inhibitory factor (this percentage was significantly higher in Manufacturers).  This programme aims to help local businesses grow by providing direct access to one to one support basis from a number of business mentors with various specialisms and areas of expertise.    Whilst there is a number of support mechanisms in place across N.Ireland research has shown that uptake for these in Fermanagh has been low.  This reflects the County's peripherality from provision, the local business culture and the small scale of many of businesses in Fermanagh.  Despite high rates of business start-up only a small minority of businesses grow significantly and the County's economic base remains characterised by a pre-dominance of micro-businesses with low turnovers. This project seeks to support entrepreneurship through a proactive intervention targeted at growth potential businesses."

This definition researches whether a product that is extensively used within schools in the Czech Republic is relevant culturally, and scientifically initially within the UK, and subsequently within the English speaking world. This schools product measures three elements within a school, the Interplay of Relationships, the Effectivity of Teaching and Learning and the Behavioural Risks.

It will provide a range of modern play equipment, complex and appropriate to a variety of ages and abilities, of a size appropriate to growing visitor numbers attending the zoo, and it will link to the wider zoo product (ie animals, habitats and wild places) via sympathetic design, branding, interpretation, landscaping, planting schemes and equipment design.    It will replace the current playground which dates back to the early 1980’s.  A recent (June 2011) playground inspection report by the Play Services NI found key elements of this playground to be in poor condition and nearing the end of their life expectancy.      The new adventure playground will be on the same site as the current playground, but will have a larger foot print.  The playground will feature a blue wet pour ‘stream’ that will run through it, and children will be able to cross this ‘stream’ via stepping stones, log bridges and a wooden boardwalk path that meanders through the area.    7 areas of the new playground (giraffe’s grassland, elephant island, bear’s bridge, gorilla glade, piranha pool, crocodile creek and lions lair) feature play activities, equipment and animal sculptures that link to the zoo’s animals.  The play equipment has a wooden, rustic appearance that mirrors play equipment in some of the animal’s enclosures and provides a visually ‘soft’ image.  A range of substrates (sand, grass, bark and wet pour) provides further variety and interest.    Interpretation through the playground will create links between play activities and the zoo's animal collection, and supply biodiversity information regarding  Northern Ireland and around the world.  It will allow a unique opportunity for us to illustrate the history and story of the zoo, its role in Belfast and Northern Ireland life, and the wild places of NI.  We believe this will be a unique approach to the prvision of play in a zoo.    The planting scheme will provide mature trees to provide instant impact, and will include shrubs, grasses and other plants to provide a tropical and visually exciting environment for play.    It will provide zoo visitors, a significant proportion of which will use the new equipment, with hugely enhanced playground facilities.      We estimate that the building work will start in September 2012, and be completed by March 2013.    We believe that the proposal provides for a very good fit to the NITB TDS's eligible destination and product type.  We further consider there will be significant business benefits to this proposal, and it provides an excellent model to fit the Northern Ireland Tourism Brand."

To achieve this we plan to floor over the Atrium at Level 4.  This will create a unique space to expand the most used exhibition area and create a major new element to extend the appeal and audience of a key family attraction in Northern Ireland.      You arrive at START as you get to the top of the musical stairs.  You enter through a new glass entrance into a new space some 14-16 metres high.  You have now two routes, the first into the science themed area and the second into the new fantasy venture space.  This new space takes the blond wood themed fantasy approach of the Castle in START into a new themed space with designed trees with platforms at approximately 7 metres high.  Laced between the platforms are bridges, one like a miniature Carrick a rede rope bridge.  But your challenge is how you get there?  Across the floor at 0.5 metres high are routes to get to the base of the trees.  These routes are physically challenging – with nets and rigging – can you make your way across?  This new space will be highly appealing to children between 5-10 and will be bespoke and unique to W5.    It has been inspired by the work of Tom Luckey in the United States and the exceptional spaces in places like Le Parc de Jeux P'tit Délire in France.  This project aims to develop an imaginative yet challenging space to appeal to a wider audience and increase W5 standing as the leading family attraction in Northern Ireland and help inward tourism especially from ROI and the GB/VFR market.           Flooring over the Atrium will also provide greater space for exhibition and conferencing at Level 4 linked to W5 highly popular lecture theatre at Level 5.  This adds to our ability to cater for conferences and link with other providers in the areas to cater for the larger Association conferances that needs many meeting/exhibition spaces.    This project is key to ensuring W5 can attract a wider audeince to help boost tourism within the Belfast area and maximise on 2012/13 opportunities where sport and physical activity is a key theme."

The CSLC will be a 300m2 multi functional three storey building, incorporating a visitor reception and information point, café, shop, toilets, exhibition space and meeting facilities. The CSLC will also develop, promote and co-ordinate secondary products and themes based on People, Industry, Music, Culture and Arts. Committed to quality, the CSLC building and elements within it will be a landmark attraction. The building will be of world-class design and positively contribute to the economic development of the area. It will be designed with passion, sensitivity and creativity and will add real value to our visitors’ experience, putting east Belfast firmly on the map. Through the CSLC we will sell east Belfast as a destination by collecting the local stories and sharing them with visitors using a mix of media and interactive elements. Whether it is a ½ hour, ½ day or a 1 day visit – the experience will be simple, focused, engaging and appeal to all audiences. Under the themes of Life, Legend and Landscape, we will tell the stories and celebrate the people of east Belfast and their unique achievements. The CSLC is critical in enabling east Belfast to develop its potential as an authentic tourist and visitor destination, as part of Belfast’s wider tourism offering, by celebrating the people, places and heritage. Attracting an estimated 147,000 visitors per year, spending £514k p.a., the CSLC will help to develop a sustainable east Belfast tourist economy, using the CSLC and Greenways to link the people and the places. The CSLC will be of exceptional standard and will give Northern Ireland another foothold in competitive world of tourism. Meeting a demonstrated and identified need, the CSLC fills a gap in the tourism market and will enable visitors to have a positive and lasting first impression of east Belfast. The Holywood Arches area is the prime location for the CSLC for a number of reasons as evidenced by the East Belfast Partnership Tourism Project – The Business Case Report. Adjacent to the C.S.Lewis square on the main arterial route and Connswater River, it is at the intersection of both Connnswater Community Greenway and the Comber Greenways which provide 30kms of traffic free routes for walkers and cyclists, linking City Centre, Titanic Quarter, East Belfast and Comber. With the addition of Belfast Rapid Transit System’s key halt, Titanic Quarter rail halt and a Belfast Tour Bus hop on hop off point, accessibility for visitors to and across Belfast will be greatly increased. The Holywood Arches area is central and accessible to the various tourist products and trails in the area including C.S.Lewis, Van Morrison, George Best, Titanic. From the CSLC visitors will have ready access to many facilities including cafes, Connswater shopping, local parks, Strand cinema, Park Avenue hotel, library etc. creating a visitor experience rather than a one stop"

This project arose as a result of discussions between lnvestNl ICT Advisor and  the company which focussed on the company’s dual sales öhannel strategy and  how they are using both trade distributors and the internet to sell their products.  The company’s existing e-commerce site interfaces to a fulfilment company’s  third party logistics software which provides all the functionality for order capture,  stock management, payment processing and shipping and currently this only  offers products in sterling and product descriptions etc are all in English. The  company are currently offering customers this 30 day product trial however it is  currently being administered manually which is imposing a considerable  overhead on the company and is also prone to error."

PCS sells CCTV Camera surveillance, sports cameras and associated equipment to both trade and retail locally and via 3rd party marketplaces.   PCS feel that the time is right to significantly invest on a new online trading platform. The vendor selected has a great deal of experience on eCommerce and has presented a detailed and inclusive quotation.  This project will have the benefit of increased sales – the site will give PCS a relevant channel into the marketplace, allowing it to sell more products and increase its turnover. And, increased capacity – the site will allow the company to further automate the online sales and back office process, allowing the company to potentially sell a higher volume of products.

Development of Company intranet    An immense amount of time is spent training franchisees in the rules, policies and procedures of being a Funky Monkey franchisee.    There is also a lot of material –policies, training records, accident reports books, birthday record sheets etc that need to be shared securely with all franchisees and most staff.    At present a huge problem exists in that different centres have out of date policies, out of date marketing material etc that is not in keeping with the franchise model. To address this issue, Funky Monkeys want to develop a company intranet, accessed via a franchisee login, to store ll these documents and records online.

With dentists increasing their purchase of items on-line it will allow the company to develop the first dedicated website to handpiece sales. The current competition has invested poorly in this media and the sites that do exist are simply a portal for telesales.   While aiming to improve sales, this will solve a stock-control and warranty issue as they develop. The aim is that through utilising the latest e-commerce packages they will be able to incorporate a single platform to run the business.  Also in this sector of dentistry there has been a distinct lack of engaging customers on-line. They aim through the web-site and social media activity to not only provide added value to the customer, but also expand the customer base with social engagement."

Moreover, the current booking system is manual and, given the increasing demand for The Jungle activities, a manual booking system is inefficient and difficult to maintain effectively.    This project will address these issues by re-creating The Jungle’s website to include a full online booking system for all activities.  The system will also have an admin backend to allow staff to continue to take telephone and walk-in bookings.    The system will have modules added which will allow new activities to be built in later – this means more upfront development but less work when adding a new activity and so it will allow the company to keep the site up-to-date and relevant for the customer"

Whilst there has been focus on FDI databases by OCO and its competitors, there are few specialised resources for trade  opportunities - which represent a much bigger market opportunity, especially as emerging economies come on stream.  Economic development agencies are generally organised to address trade and investment as separate activities, but there is a growing realisation and acceptance that both activities are inextricably linked. OCO are looking for a way to better capture, exploit and package corporate intelligence for the needs primarily of trade and investment organisations but also to package  information for private sector clients, particularly those looking for global export partners. Also over the past 5 years, ‘Greenfield’ investment is becoming a less preferred mode of investment for emerging economies and Merger & Acquisition (M&A;) has been a dominant trend. If correctly configured, the new database platform and associated interrogation functionality would also be a valuable resource in the provision of M&A; services.  OCO’s two existing platforms were built with different intentions, one to help identify companies  with the highest propensity to invest and the other to track interactions with companies (a bespoke CRM tailored for the FDI decision making process). OCO are currently expanding and setting up a Business Processes Operation (BPO), and see this new product as having significant productivity impacts and represents an opportunity to address what corporate data is collated,  how it is collated, how it is interrogated and how it is packaged and sold. In this way, the new platform will form the core process for the analysts working in the new BPO operation."

This opportunity results from an increase in the growth within two key markets, the aggregate processing industry and the waste recycling industry, these are both global by nature and particular opportunities exist within developing economies.  Management has, in the past, demonstrated their ability to identify and fully exploit market opportunity.  In this instance they see a number of constraints, these include manufacturing capacity, ongoing product development and expanding and upskilling the workforce.     In view of the above, the proposed mobile project comprises 3 elements, capital, R & D and BITP.  These are discussed in more detail in Section 2, however a brief overview follows.      The capital element relates to the construction of a new purpose-built 100,000 sq ft factory at Granville and the fitting out of same.  The Company purchased this site from Invest NI in 2007 but due to economic conditions, did not develop it at the time.  The existing facilities near Coalisland would be retained.  The new factory would be equipped with, amongst other things, state-of-the-art robotic welders and a new paint booth.    The R & D element relates to the development of two “closed circuit” crusher based machines.  Crushers in the current product range expel crushed material directly as stockpiles and operators are required to purchase additional equipment to sort and recycle oversized material.  The proposed project would enable this oversized material to be re-circulated and crushed to the required size thereby reducing the operators overall capital costs and increasing the efficiency of the crusher system.    As noted in the “Notes to the Reader” the BITP project has not been fully worked up yet.  A separate application is to be prepared and will be submitted in due course.  Whilst assistance will be based on that application, this casework seeks approval of a grant rate of 30% of eligible costs, subject to a maximum of £300k.  This approach will provide the client with visibility of a total package of assistance of £1,933k, subject to eligible training costs being in line with that included in the business plan and the future training plan being broadly in line with the 2007 training plan."

This has meant that IT  infrastructure enhancements have been patchy, sharing of information has been poor,  and it’s a daily occurrence to drive to the other site with data on a memory pen or DVD  to share with other key workers.

These traps retain a  range of Fats Oils and Greases (hereafter FOGs) from washing up areas, sinks etc. Many  regional government’s environmental agencies have strict controls about the level of FOGs that  can be discharged to sewers. They are particularly difficult to eliminate, cause an undue burden  on waste treatment plants and literally block sewage infrastructure when they solidify as wash  water cools. Legislation requires commercial premises to establish grease traps for this reason  and strict controls are enforced on FOG discharge.  EPAS has an innovative active grease trap range called “GreaseShield” which automatically  removes food scraps and FOGs from waste water as it passes through. The Company strategy is  to grow sales volumes and diversify into other global markets. The standards for these countries include higher FOG retention efficiency i.e. cleaner effluent as well as requirements  for in device storage.  EPAS needs to develop new GreaseShield products that can combine their active technology  but deal with deal with larger effluent discharge rates and FOG storage. Whilst current Grease  Shields (Diagram 1 below) currently perform well these additional requirements are proving a  barrier to further commercialisation.  Diagram 1.

During this project 3 sizes of GreaseShield will be developed: 10, 20 and 35 gallons of waste  water per minute systems.

The Company has built some bespoke larger systems e.g. Hilton Hotel Manchester but these  have been standard sump type grease traps.

Current  employment is 86 staff.  In the past eighteen months the company has been considering strategic developments  into the high growth markets of aerospace and oil and gas. This resulted in the  establishment of a new division, Hutchinson AeroTech in the Autumn 2013 in Antrim to  develop aerospace activities.  The company now has two sites with core activities based in Kilrea and the aerospace  developments in Antrim. This, when combined with the increased growth, has stressed  the existing MIS system.  This project arose from ongoing discussions with the client’s management team and  addressed a potential key barrier to growth as the company requires enhanced  information systems to meet the growth in both core and new markets.  Following recent investments in plant and machinery the company has successfully  grown the new aerospace division and is generating good levels of growth in export and  local business from this and the traditional engineering work. Having carried out a  review of the business ICT it has been identified that growth has made investment in  new software essential.  Key requirements are:  • Nesting software to increase sheet utilisation and reduce programming time  • ERP and CAD software for the aerospace division  This project is to address these two issues and purchase critical software, installation  assistance and user training."

To host these applications the company also plan to upgrade their network  infrastructure.  The software suite will provide the company with total visibility of information held in a central  database for all sales and service activities. The service management software will facilitate control  of all aspects of contract management from the initial call/job logging, managing the response  time, resource and parts required to the final invoicing. Maintaining contract and customer details  and also the various items located on site, the system will provide a full drill down history on each  item providing information as to the warranty status, service cover and service history. Allocation of  the call will be controlled by either location, skill type required or simple availability rules and the  software will monitor service level response times.  The software will also provide functionality for contract/job costing capturing both cost elements  and revenue postings over the life of the contract. Contract billing functionality will include contract  reminders and invoice generation.  The CRM module will enable the company to plan, execute and measure targeted campaigns using  special interests and demographics, tracking the success of campaigns and generating accurate  return on investment information. It will also facilitate the central storage of all correspondence  with a customer ensuring that all relevant documentation will be immediately available to any  authorised user.

CK proposes to design a new twin rammed baler with a integrated bale wrapper that will  wrap the bale as it is ejected from the baler in a fully automatic cycle.  This will eliminate the need to tie the bale before wrapping, reducing the cost of the  overall system by approximately £20,600 for a wire tier or £24,500 for a plastic strapper.  To produce the wrapping system the hydraulic and electrical control needs to be  developed. Hydraulic ram specification needs to be analysed to ensure correct  compaction for finer materials and full ejection. Hydraulic components need to be  specified to ensure correct operation of wrapper. Electrical equipment for sensing and  safeguarding has to be specified."

The company subsequently submitted an application form for  Growth Accelerator Programme (GAP) funding. However, further information was  required and requested. There is now sufficient information to progress a submission for  financial support in the form of Selective Financial Assistance (SFA) instead of GAP.  This is due to the fact that it was established that there would be local job creation over  and above that initially discussed and more importantly, over and above the target set  under the existing Jobs Fund project. The client is content with this approach as all  support applied for under GAP can be delivered via SFA.  RGM’s recent growth has primarily been through external contracts with a number of  large companies. It has completed work in GB for Sainsbury, Tesco, LIDL, Asda and  IKEA. RGM has also undertaken work in the ROl for the Frankie and Benny’s restaurant  chain, completing work on five restaurants there.  Raymond Murphy and Maurice Grant believe that RGM can achieve a turnover of £2  million by 2015. The management of the company is currently under extreme pressure  handling increased business and is finding difficulty in effectively dealing with enquiries  for potential new contracts. They believe that a new technical sales position needs to be  created to deal with this issue. They also believe that whilst the company has attained a  high proportion of business on a referral and word of mouth basis, it is insufficient to rely  on this approach for future growth. Therefore as well as increasing technical sales  capability, RGM will seek to more proactively market itself and increase its industry  profile. To this end, the company will substantially increase market development  activities and company/brand awareness to potential new customers."

The company has an in-house facility to design and  manufacture almost any profile from outline drawings. The mouldings are manufactured from  moisture resistant medium density fibre board (MDFMR) and are sold through builders merchants  throughout the UK, Ireland and more recently in the Netherlands. The Company provides a cost  effective alternative to traditional timber mouldings. The Client plans to complete an R&D; project  which will allow it to offer a superior and more durable fully finished MDF moulding for use within  the building sector. Therefore SAM proposes to develop a process which will allow it to apply fully  finished spray coatings that will be UV cured onto their profiled products. The UV curing  technology currently exists and is used extensively in Scandinavia for fully finished applications to  flat boards. The technology would be new to Northern Ireland and there would be significant  technical challenge to apply the required fully finished coating to the profiled products  manufactured by SAM Mouldings. The Company currently only has the ability to apply vacuum  coated and air dried finished products using water based coatings which currently requires two  passes through the production line to create a primed finish and up to four passes to create a  more finished profiled product which is inferior to their competitors’ offerings. It is hoped that  successful completion of this project would lead to the profile requiring only one pass through the  production machinery and eliminate the need for a priming coat being applied.  SAM has had limited success with their product portfolio within Europe, as they can currently only  meet customer requirements for primed finish products. There is an increasing demand within  Europe for the supply of fully finished profiles, particularly in Scandinavia where fully finished  products are the preferred product choice. The Client believes that this demand will also increase  within the UK once a proven durable fully finished profile has been developed to the customers  required standards."

It will provide the company with an  inspection management solution that will enable the company to automate all aspects of  the inspection lifecycle surrounding Lifting Equipment in remote sites. It will offer a  backend administration system which is seamlessly integrated to both a web client and  remote VPN version for on-site engineers, with a customer web client available enabling  them to log calls, view and download reports and view equipment and inspection  history.  The administration system will facilitate annual planning and resource planning and will  provide route automation based on post code. It will maintain a register of equipment  and details of the current location and will facilitate the allocation of engineers to jobs  based upon their certifications. It will automate the test process reporting via the use of  laptop or PDA with both internet connectivity and/or off line synchronisation via VPN  available. The system will enable the generation of ROTE and test certificates and  exam registers to meet industry standard inspection requirements and will automate the  compilation of inspection reports. This back office system will also provide business  process functionality in that it will automate the QA and approval of reports by  interfacing with Exchange server.  The Engineer’s system is available in two versions offering the company a choice of  deployment. The first is a laptop version which can be used either directly connected to  the office network via a VPN or in offline mode with the data being synchronised to the  back office system when the laptop is connected. The second version is a Web version  which can be deployed via a PDA which will facilitate immediate transfer of data to the  back office system.  The secure Client portal is fully integrated with the Inspection database meaning that  reports will be available to the Client the instant they have been completed or  synchronised with the back office database and approved.  To host this new application the company also plans to upgrade its network server to  ensure adequate processing power and data storage capability. The Client also plans to  upgrade their Pegasus Opera II software to Opera III which will ensure that the  company are using a supported product during the next few years and will also offer  enhanced functionality such as Credit Management functionality, Open Period  Accounting and improved reporting with easier exporting to Excel.

The  Company has experience in working on a wide portfolio of different building types from  residential housing to large and complex public buildings. The Company’s focus is on  design and to date has focussed on bespoke design of houses and buildings. In more  recent times they have evolved into the design of Public Space as evidence by their  Completion of the design of the public square at Copenhagen Town Hail.  Established in 2004, Turnover in Year End Accounts for June 2013 was £349,243; up to  date management accounts for 30/4/2014 show a Turnover of £742,249. Projected  Year End Turnover for 30th June 2014 is £897,000 with a Profit before Tax of £489,000.  They currently employ 9 people.  In a geographical split of Sales from May 2013— May 2014; NI represented 33.4%,  Other UK, 66.2% and other EU 0.4%.  In this project the company plan to install Autodesk Building Design Suite Ultimate and  Premium packages and replace their AutoCAD LTe with AutoCAD 2014, To host this  software the company need to significantly upgrade their network infrastructure to  ensure that there is both adequate response times and storage capacity available.  The Autodesk Building Design Suite Premium and Ultimate software will provide the  company with the ability to capture and analyze concepts and maintain the project  vision through design, documentation, and construction. The provision of specialised  features for conceptual design, analysis, rendering, and coordinated documentation will  streamline the workflow associated with the creation of the 3D model from the initial  conceptual design. This 3D model and associated database will then form the basis for  the other disciplines such as M & E to add their own design parameters to the model.  This will allow a single model and associated database to be maintained, ensuring that  all parties have the latest information and that there are no errors in translation.  In the first instance, the company plan to implement a 2 seats of the BIM software  (Ultimate & Premium) and support this with 5 seats of AutoCAD 2014 which will enable  other users to design and have two users capable of specifying items in the BIM  software.  To date, 3D CAD models have tended to be in the order of 4-10 GB of data however  Revit files tend to be an order of magnitude larger with 100 GB files typical of the  completed design. To cope with this significant increase in file size the company plan to  install new network file sewer with 5T8 of storage. A 24TB NAS will be deployed to  provide the data backup medium. There is also a need to upgrade a number of  workstations to cope with this new software.  This Project arose from the identification that there is a significant move within the  International Construction and Design sector towards incorporating BIM into the entire  building lifeçycle, and companies attempting to compete in this marketplace need to be able to incorporate BIM into their design processes and workflow."

To host these new software applications the  company also plans to upgrade their network infrastructure to facilitate the  implementation of a disaster recovery plan.  This enterprise software will provide the core accounting ledgers together with  operational construction specific functionality dealing with subcontractor management,  HMRC CIS requirements, contract costing, procurement, plant management, retentions  and sales. The document management software will provide functionality for document  check in and check out with full revision history, published and unpublished versions, so  that changed content is not visible until authorised, and full access history showing who  read which revision of a document when. In addition the system allows creation of  documents from context sensitive user defined templates. Content created this way will  be placed in the correct folder automatically ensuring consistent filing of documents in  the system. The security model allows for delegated authority over areas of the content  module, such that users can be given the ability to access, amend, publish and setup  the authority for others to do likewise within their restricted areas of the system  The email archiving module will act as an integrated part of the company’s email  infrastructure. Mail can be cloned to the systems SMTP service where it can be  classified and attached to the correct project or contact record it relates to. Responses  to e-mails issued from the Contact Management Modules will be automatically linked to  the original e-mail. This will allow the complete history of correspondence with a contact  to be maintained.  As the company plan to make Summit Web the single central point of access to a  variety of structured and unstructured data the plan is to assemble all of these functions  into a set of user friendly dash boards or tabular dialogs.

Trevor referred this client to the Belfast office and it was picked up by NEO.  Heyn Engineering has broadened its services from traditional marine engineering to include a  comprehensive range of lifting equipment and accessories, machinery installation/removal, load testing,  material handling projects. It has one of the last remaining crane rigging workshops in Ireland with the  capability to manufacture bespoke ""under-hook"" lifting accessories which it has successfully sold in N1 for  the last 6 years. Under- hook accessories are the consumables products used to attach things to cranes  such as chains, web slings, spreader beams, hooks/ couplings and shackles. The crane lifts up and down  and side to side and has an integral hook to attach the crane to the load you need to move.  The company's strategic ambition is to expand this unique ""under-hook"" lifting accessory business into  the ROt and GB markets. All products will be manufactured on site at Heyn Eng and marketed both online  and via direct sales. The company has dipped its toe into the GB market and has achieved initial sales of  £242k without any heavy promotion. It has also identified opportunities in the ROI market.  Heyn Eng has approached Invest N1 for financial and advisory support to enable it to promote this locally  focused business to move into 2 new markets. The objective is to grow sales in ROI and GB by investing in  the current online delivery channel and increasing its direct sales and marketing activities in these  markets. To facilitate the company's export development strategy two full time positions are required: a  Sales Executive to drive direct 'under-hook' sales in the ROI market; and an Online Marketing Executive  to market the bespoke /under-hook/ business in GB. The new sales and marketing staff will be supported  by a programme of market development activities. To underpin the successful implementation of this  strategy and achieve the uplift in sales 2 additional Workshop Engineers will also be recruited. The  parallel MIS case supporting the MIS infrastructure/ CRM and specialist software will also contribute to  the success of this project.  An Export Start SFA case of £36,000 (£28k revenue grant and £8k development grant) is proposed to  assist Heyn Engineering (N1) Ltd to implement its export development plan to achieved sales in UK and  ROI and recruit 4 new staff  The main objectives of this project are:  .

The software will automatically correct faults  such as checking PDF files for RGB images and automatically converting them  to CMYK. It will automatically handle the conversion to and from pantone colours  and check font embedding, font size, font type and number of separations in  combination with font size. It will automatically download and embed missing  fonts and also check if both hidden layers and bleed are present in the file.  The Imposition software performs one of the fundamental steps in the prepress  process in determining the arrangement of the printed product’s pages on the  printer’s sheet, in order to obtain faster printing, simplify bindinp and reduce  paper waste. This software uses XML metadata to determine how a file will be  imposed and will enable the company to add variable data on pages and to  scale pages equally. It will also automatically deal with a document that has a  mixture of tall and wide and mirror alignment on back of sheets. The software  utilises a “Watched” folder methodology."

"Ernest McConville","SFA less than 250k - Project 14","2014","90,000.00","2016","31,764.54","","P2","£ 409,091.00","The company has approached Invest NI seeking capital support for additional  investment. As part of a strategic review of the business the company is moving to new  premises as their current location can no longer accommodate their growth. They intend  moving to a 12000 sq ft unit which will enable more efficient production layout, materials  handling and storage and enough space for growth in the future. The company is self  funding this move.  Growth over the past two years has required the company to look further at potential  new opportunities to develop the business; this includes additional capability and  efficiency in their manufacturing processes. The company has identified new  opportunities to supply more sophisticated printed materials with greater colour diversity  and doubled sided print capability in one pass (perfecting). This is an important addition  to company capability and is increasingly demanded by current and potential customers,  especially in the food and health sectors where packaging is an essential selling point as  part of the brand image. The company supply product to clients of the major multiples  (Hilton Eoods, Mash Direct) the multiples require increasingly more complex print  combinations. Packaging is increasingly an aesthetic element but it also provides an  education medium to customers in the use of products (recipes, special offers,  information). Whilst the company can offer this on their sheet fed single pass through  machine by manually loading for reverse printing, this is a time consuming and inefficient  process requiring additional set up and run times. The ‘perfecting’ process will deliver  greater internal efficiencies and output gains in production. The enhancement is  regarded as an essential part of the company strategic development over the next 3  years to offer enhanced capability to potential clients, reducing lead and delivery times  and strengthening relationships and retaining business plus opening new opportunities  to expand into new sectors such as Health and Beauty where product information is  important and clients must maximize packaging space to satisfy the growing numbers of languages and legislative information required on products etc.  The press will deliver greater production efficiencies due to double-sided one-pass  printing, automated plate loading and computer controlled functionality, ink management  systems resulting in significant production time reduction, estimated to be in the region  of 20-50% in set up cycle times and the increased output speed per minute of up to  18,000 sheets per minute giving a 20% output gain. The computer controlled ink  delivery and spot colour/sealer application delivers higher definition print and improved  quality and consistency across a run. In addition costs of basic raw materials will reduce  by 40% as waste is curtailed. Overall the company are estimating that running costs will  reduce by 30% on average. The advantage of computer controlled optimised  performance will enable the company to monitor and record outputs to measure  efficiency.  They have submitted an application to Invest NI seeking support towards the purchase  of a 2nd hand off set litho press. Currently there is availability of good second hand  equipment in the sector due to the unfortunate number of printers experiencing difficulty  and ceasing to trade. Second hand machinery is the preferred option as it will enable  the business to manage cash flow effectively whilst improving their in-house capability  economically.  The company is seeking to purchase the equipment and initiate the project by March  2014. The company is of the opinion that this is an opportunity to invest for growth. They  are keen to develop new sales and have an intention to provide a wider range of  packaging products into new sectors. The timing of the investment is during what is  traditionally a quieter period for the trade and links with their move to new larger facilities  which will minimize disruption to production cycles. Their market research identifies new  opportunities to expand their food packaging offering as well as targeting new business  in the FMCG, Health and Beauty sectors where the print and packaging quality is  integral to the branding process and as a result the packaging has a greater complexity  with a higher value added component. It is envisaged that the investment will bring PP  to a new level through added value products generating new sales and growth.  The company will recruit 3 additional staff, this has been noted in the application but the  grant will be directed to the PME element.  They have an experienced and motivated sales team and the project has the potential to  achieve it targets."
