This pioneering project is the first of its kind to be established and run by a council in Northern Ireland. By salvaging and restoring these at the 3,000 sq. ft. warehouse, the Council is saving landfill space, reducing waste handling and disposal costs, offsetting the energy or raw materials needed to produce new products and creating training opportunities for local people.     Restore brings together all three strands of the Council’s sustainable development commitment - environmental, economic and social well-being. Environmentally, restore ensures that the life of household furniture is prolonged rather than prematurely discarded in landfill – thereby saving the planet’s supply of raw materials needed to produce new products. Goods are often only waste by virtue of the fact that the original owner has had them for a period of time and fancies a change. But given a new owner and a new home, the goods effectively become new again. Economically, restore helps reduce landfill costs on local ratepayers while at the same time making low cost household goods available to the public. Socially, it fulfils a valuable social role by creating training opportunities for local people. All profits from the sale of the refurbished, second-hand furniture will be ploughed back into restore.
